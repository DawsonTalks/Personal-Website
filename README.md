Hey! Welcome to the GitHub Repository for my personal website. You can use this code as much as you like, I just request that my credits are left in the code. If you need any help with this site, please contact me on Discord at JackD#7172.

For the Spotify & Discord features to work, you must join the Lanyard server on Discord. Click [here](https://discord.gg/7awUJEfJ5c) to join.
You will also need to add your user ID in assets/backend/lanyard.js for the script to work.

Thank you to @UpbeatBenne for his CORS-anywhere proxy that allows the connection to work in the first place.
